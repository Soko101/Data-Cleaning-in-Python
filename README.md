# Data Cleaning in Pandas
This project demonstrates essential data cleaning techniques using pandas on a customer contact dataset. The cleaning steps include:

✅ Removing duplicate records using .drop_duplicates()

✅ Standardizing inconsistent entries (e.g., names, phone numbers)

✅ Cleaning up missing values and garbage placeholders like "N/a" or "nan--"

✅ Normalizing categorical values (e.g., converting "Yes", "Y", "No", "N" to consistent formats)

✅ Splitting address data into structured components (Street, State, Zip)

The final cleaned dataset was exported to Excel and is ready for analysis or use in downstream pipelines.
